# What is the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test?

### The Dickey-Fuller test:

* **It is one of the most popular statistical tests. It is used to determine the presence of unit roots in a series and hence helps us to understand if the series is stationary or not.**
    

The null and alternate hypothesis for this test is:

1. **Null Hypothesis**: The series has a unit root (value of a =1)
    
2. **Alternate Hypothesis**: The series has no unit root.
    

* If we fail to reject the null hypothesis, we can say that the series is non-stationary.
    
* This means that the series can be linear or difference stationary.
