### Customer Segmentation

- **Customer Segmentation** is also known as **market segmentation**.

- It means **dividing customers into groups based on similar functionality.**

- For example, think of a pet store, each customer has a very unique preference when choosing a pet.

- The type of pet a customer buys is highly dependent on the type of animal they love, the type of lifestyle and income they have, and many other factors.

- So, according to this example customers of a pet store can be clustered according to the type of animal they prefer and the income they earn.
