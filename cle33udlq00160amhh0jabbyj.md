# What are Tensors?

In mathematics, **it is an algebraic object that describes the linear mapping from one set of algebraic objects to another.**

* Objects that the tensors may map between include, but are not limited to the vectors, scalars, and recursively, even other tensors (for example, a matrix is a map between vectors and thus a tensor. Therefore the linear map between matrices is also the tensor).
    
* Tensors are inherently related to vector spaces and their dual spaces and can take several different forms.
    
* For example, a scalar, a vector, a dual vector at a point, or a multi-linear map between vector spaces.
    
* Euclidean vectors and scalars are simple tensors. While tensors are defined as independent of any basis.
    
* The physics literature is often referred to by its components on a basis related to a particular coordinate system.
