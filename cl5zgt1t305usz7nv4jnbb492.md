- **Bias** is the **difference between predicted values and expected results**.

- **Variance** is the **variability of your model's predictions over different sets of data**.

- A machine learning model with **a low bias is a perfect model and a model with a high bias is expected with a high error rate on the training and test sets.**

- A machine learning model with **high variance indicates that the model may work well on the data it was trained on, but it will not generalize well on the dataset it has never seen before.**
