# What is the learning Rate?

**The learning rate controls how much we should adjust the weights concerning the loss gradient. Learning rates are randomly initialized.**

* Lower the values of the learning rate slower will be the convergence to global minima.
    
* Higher values for the learning rate will not allow the gradient descent to converge.
    
* Since our goal is to minimize the function cost to find the optimized value for weights, we run multiples iteration with different weights and calculate the cost to arrive at a minimum cost.
