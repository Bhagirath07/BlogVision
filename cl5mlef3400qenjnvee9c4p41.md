# Data Science Interview Question 2

# Why is the Naïve Bayes Algorithm known as Naïve?

- #### The Naïve Bayes Algorithm is said to be naïve because of its naïve assumption. 

- #### This implies the conditional independence of cause.

- #### Simply put, the presence of one cause is not normally independent of the presence of other causes.

- #### This can be considered very difficult to accept in many cases where the probability of a particular feature is strictly correlated with another feature.
