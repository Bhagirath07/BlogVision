# What is the Confusion Matrix?

* **A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model (or “classifier”) on a set of test data for which the true values are known.**
    
* It allows **the visualization of the performance of an algorithm.**
    
* A confusion matrix is a summary of prediction results on a classification problem.
    
* The number of **correct** and **incorrect predictions** is summarized with count values and broken down by each class.
    

* This is the key to the confusion matrix.
    
* It gives us insight not only into the errors being made by a classifier but, more importantly, the types of errors that are being made.

Here,

* Class 1: **Positive**
    
* Class 2: **Negative**
    

Definition of the Terms:

1. **Positive (P):** Observation is positive
    
2. **Negative (N):** Observation is not positive
    
3. **True Positive (TP):** Observation is positive, and is predicted to be positive.
    
4. **False Negative (FN):** Observation is positive, but is predicted negative.
    
5. **True Negative (TN):** Observation is negative, and is predicted to be negative.
    
6. **False Positive (FP):** Observation is negative, but is predicted positive.
