# What is Mean Absolute Error?

## What is Absolute Error?

**Absolute Error is the amount of error in your measurements.**

* It is the difference between the measured value and the “true” value.
    
* For example, if a scale states 90 pounds, but you know your true weight is 89 pounds, then the scale has an absolute error of 90 lbs – 89 lbs = 1 lbs.
    

## Mean Absolute Error

The Mean Absolute Error(MAE) is **the average of all absolute errors.**

#### Formula:

Where,

* **n = the number of errors**
    
* **Σ = summation symbol** (which means “add them all up”)
    
* **|xi – x| = the absolute errors**
    

* The formula may look a little daunting, but the steps are easy:
    

1. Find all of your absolute errors
    
2. xi – x. Add them all up
    
3. Divide by the number of errors
