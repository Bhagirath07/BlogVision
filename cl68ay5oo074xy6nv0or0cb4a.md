# Machine Learning Algorithms Every Data Scientist Must Know

## Machine Learning Algorithms are divided into Three Categories : 

### 1. Classification 

- Decision Tree

- Naive Bayes

- K-nearest Neighbors

- Support Vector Machine

- Passive Aggressive Classifier


### 2. Clustering 

- K Means Clustering

- DBSCAN Clustering

- Agglomerative Clustering

- BIRCH Clustering

- Affinity Clustering

- Spectral Clustering


### 3. Regression

- Linear Regression

- Logistic Regression

- Decision Tree Regression

- Random Forest

- Ridge Regression

- Lasso Regression

- Passive Aggressive Regression
