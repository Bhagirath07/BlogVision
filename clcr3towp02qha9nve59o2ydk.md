# What is the Mean Median Mode standard deviation for the sample and population?

## Mean:

* **It is an important technique in statistics.**
    
* **Arithmetic Mean** can also be called an **average**.
    
* It is the number of the quantity obtained by summing two or more numbers/variables and then dividing the sum by the number of numbers/variables.

## Mode:

* **The mode is also one of the types for finding the average.**
    
* A mode is a number that occurs most frequently in a group of numbers.
    
* Some series might not have any mode; some might have two modes, which is called a bimodal series. I
    
* In the study of statistics, the three most common ‘averages’ in statistics are mean, median, and mode.

## Median:

* **It is also a way of finding the average of a group of data points. It’s the middle number of a set of numbers.**
    
* There are two possibilities, the data points can be an odd number group, or it can be an even number group.
    
* If the group is odd, arrange the numbers in the group from smallest to largest.
    
* The median will be the one that is exactly sitting in the middle, with an equal number on either side of it.
    
* If the group is even, arrange the numbers in order and pick the two middle numbers and add them then divide by 2. It will be the median number of that set.

## Standard Deviation (Sigma):

* **Standard Deviation is a measure of how much your data is spread out in statistics.**
