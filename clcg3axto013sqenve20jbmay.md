# What is ZCA Whitening?

### Zero Component Analysis:

* **Making the co-variance matrix the Identity matrix** is called **whitening**.
    
* This will remove the **first and second-order statistical structure**.
    
* ZCA transforms **the data to zero means and makes the features linearly independent of each other In some image analysis applications**, **especially when working with images of the color and tiny type**, **it is frequently interesting to apply some whitening to the data before**, e.g. **training a classifier**.
