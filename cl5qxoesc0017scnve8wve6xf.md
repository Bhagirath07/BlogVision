- #### Here are some of the questions you should always ask about your data when working on a data science project:


> 1. Is the dataset skewed towards a range of values?
> 
> 2. Are there any missing values in the dataset? If yes, what approach you should choose to fill the missing values?
> 
> 3. Are there any outliers in the data? If yes, then how you will handle those outliers?
>
