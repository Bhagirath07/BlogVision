# Data Science Interview Question 12

# Which Strategy you should choose to deal with missing values and why?

- The first strategy is to remove the entire row containing a missing value.

- This is not a bad idea, but it can only be considered when the data is very large.

- If removing missing values results in a data shortage, then this will not be an ideal dataset for any data science task.

- This is where the second strategy comes in, which is to the mean, median, or mode of the other known values.

- This strategy can be considered in any type of dataset.
