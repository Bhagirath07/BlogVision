- Spare PCA is **a specialized variant of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in machine learning** that is used in **statistical analysis, especially when analyzing multivariate data.**

- Sparse PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset by introducing sparsity structures in the input features.

- Using the **standard PCA**, you can only select the **most important midrange features, assuming each instance can be rebuilt using the same components. **

- By using a **sparse PCA**, you can use a limited number of components, but without the limitation given by a dense projection matrix. 

- This can be done using a **sparse matrix**, where **the number of non-zero elements is quite low.**
