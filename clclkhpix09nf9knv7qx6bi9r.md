# What is t-SNE?

- (t-SNE) t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding is a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm used for exploring high-dimensional data. It maps multi-dimensional data to two or more dimensions suitable for human observation. 

- With the help of the t-SNE algorithms, you may have to plot fewer exploratory data analysis plots next time you work with high-dimensional data.
