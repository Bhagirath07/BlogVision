# What are binomial distribution and polynomial distribution?

## Binomial Distribution:

**A binomial distribution can be thought of as simply the probability of a SUCCESS or FAILURE outcome in an experiment or survey that is repeated multiple times.**

* The binomial is a type of distribution that has two possible outcomes (the prefix “bi” means two, or twice).
    

#### For example:

* a coin toss has only two possible outcomes: heads or tails, and taking a test could have two possible outcomes: pass or fail.
    

## Multinomial / Polynomial Distribution:

**Multi or Poly means many. In probability theory, the multinomial distribution is a generalization of the binomial distribution.**

#### For example:

* it models the probability of counts of each side for rolling a k-sided die n times.
    
* For n independent trials each of which leads to success for exactly one of k categories, with each category having a given fixed success probability, the multinomial distribution gives the probability of any particular combination of numbers \\of successes for the various categories.
