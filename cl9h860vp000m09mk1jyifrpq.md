- Typically Web Development has 3 essential parts:


1. FrontEnd - "What Users See"
2. BackEnd - "All the logic part, data processing"
3. Database - "Where data is stored"


### #1. The Basics of the Internet.

- Learn the terms used.

- Learn What is Hosting, Domain, and Server.


### #2. HTML + CSS

- HTML and CSS are the fundamentals of learning how to build websites.


### #3. JavaScript

- An excellent next step is to learn vanilla javascript.

### #4. DOM & JQuery

- Learn DOM and JQuery, which is a javascript library that makes DOM manipulation easier.


### #5. Frontend Framework

- It's Optional and needed for full-stack.


### #6. Python
