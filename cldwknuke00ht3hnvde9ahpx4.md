# What is Time Series Analysis?

### Time series analysis:

- It involves developing models that best capture or describe an observed time 
series to understand the underlying cause.

- This study seeks the “why” behind the time-series datasets.

- This involves making assumptions about the form of data and decomposing time series into the constitution component.

- The quality of the descriptive model is determined by how well it describes all available data and the interpretation it provides to inform the problem domain better.
