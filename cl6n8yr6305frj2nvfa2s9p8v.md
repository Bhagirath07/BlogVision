# Data Science Interview Question 15

# What is a Classification Report?

- A Classification Report is **one of the performance evaluation metrics of a classification-based machine learning model.**

- It displays your model's **precision**, **recall**, **F1 score** and **support**.

- It provides **a better understanding of the overall performance of our trained model.**

- To understand **the classification report of a machine learning model**, one should know all **the metrics displayed in the report**.

- Below are all the metrics shown by a classification report:


1. **Precision**:
 - Precision is defined as **the ratio of true positives to the sum of true and false positives**.

2. **Recall**:
 - Recall is defined as **the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives**.

3. **F1 Score**: 
 - The F1 score is **the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall**.
 - The closer the value of **the F1 Score is to 1.0**, the better the expected performance of the model.

4. **Support**:
 - Support is **the number of actual occurrences of the class in the dataset**.
 - It doesn't vary between **models**, it just diagnoses **the performance evaluation process**.
