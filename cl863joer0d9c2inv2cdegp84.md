### Machine Learning: 

- ML is a **form of AI that is based on more data** and **it can change actions and responses**, which will make it more efficient, adaptable and scalable. e.g., navigation apps and recommendation engines. 

- Machine Learning Classified into:-


1. **Supervised**
2. **Unsupervised**
3. **Reinforcement Learning**


### Data Science: 

- Data science has many **tools**, **techniques**, and **algorithms **called from these fields, plus others –to handle **big data**.

- The goal of data science, somewhat similar to machine learning, is to **make accurate predictions and to 
automate and perform transactions in real-time**, such as purchasing internet traffic or automatically 
generating content.

- **Data science relies less on math and coding and more on data and building new systems to process the 
data**. 

- Relying on the fields of **data integration**, **distributed architecture**, **automated machine learning**, **data visualization**, **data engineering**, and **automated data-driven decisions**, data science can cover an entire spectrum of data processing, not only the algorithms or statistics related to data.


### Deep Learning: 

- **It is a technique for implementing ML**.

- **ML provides the desired output from a given input, but DL reads the input and applies it to other data.** 
In ML, we can easily classify the flower based on its features. Suppose you want a machine to look at 
an image and determine what it represents to the human eye, whether a face, flower, landscape, truck, 
building, etc.

- Machine learning is not sufficient for this task because machine learning can only produce an output from 
a data set – whether according to a known algorithm or based on the inherent structure of the data. You 
might be able to use machine learning to determine whether an image was of an “X” – a flower, say – and 
it would learn and get more accurate. But that output is binary (yes/no) and is dependent on the 
algorithm, not the data. In the image recognition case, the outcome is not binary and not dependent on 
the algorithm.

- The neural network performs MICRO calculations with computational on many layers. Neural networks 
also support weighting data for ‘confidence. These results in a probabilistic system, vs. deterministic, and 
can handle tasks that we think of as requiring more ‘human-like’ judgment.


### Artificial Intelligence: 

- **AI** is pure **math** and **science**, but when it became computational, **it 
started to solve human problems formalized into a subset of computer science.** 

- Artificial intelligence has changed **the original computational statistics paradigm to the modern idea that machines could mimic actual human capabilities**, such as decision-making and performing more “human” tasks. 

- Modern AI into two categories:

 - **General AI** - Planning, decision making, identifying objects, recognizing sounds, social & 
business transactions.

 - **Applied AI** - driverless/ Autonomous car or machine smartly trade stocks.
