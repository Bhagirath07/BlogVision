- **Linear Regression** is **a statistical technique** used as **a machine algorithm to understand the relationship between a dependent and independent variable.**

- This is a **supervised learning** algorithm that is **used in regression-based problem statements such as predicting future sales, future stock prices, etc.**

- It is a great algorithm for **regression analysis**, but it is **not as powerful as other regression algorithms** because **it is affected by outlines as it assumes that the dataset is normally distributed without having any Outliners.**

- So, whenever you use linear regression, **make sure that the dataset is normally distributed without having any outlines.**


### Assumption of Linear Regression 

- Below are the assumptions of the linear regression algorithm that you should know:


1. **There is a linear relationship between dependent and independent features.**

2. **All the features are multivariate normally.**

3. **There is very little or no multicollinearity in the dataset.**

4. There is very little or no autocorrection in the dataset.

5. **It also assumes that there is homoscedasticity in the dataset.**
