# What do you understand by the trend of data?

**A general systematic linear or (most often) nonlinear component that changes over time and does not repeat.**

* There are different approaches to understanding trends.
    
* A positive trend means it is likely that growth continues. Let's illustrate this with a simple example:

Great, now itâ€™s clear theirs a trend in the graph by adding **Linear Regression.**
