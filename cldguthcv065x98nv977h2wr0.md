# What is Darknet?

* DarkNet is a framework used to train neural networks; it is open source and written in C/CUDA and serves as the basis for YOLO.
    
* Darknet is also used as the framework for training YOLO, meaning it sets the architecture of the network.
    
* Clone the repo locally, and you have it. To compile it, run a make. But first, if you intend to use the GPU capability, you need to edit the **Makefile** in the first two lines, where you tell it to compile for GPU usage with CUDA drivers.
