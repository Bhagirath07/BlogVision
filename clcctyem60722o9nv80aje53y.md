# What is Accuracy and Misclassification Rate?

### Accuracy:

* Accuracy is defined as the ratio of **the sum of True Positive and True Negative by Total(TP+TN+FP+FN).**
    

> $$Accuracy = TP + TN / TP + TN + FP + FN$$

* **However, there are problems with accuracy. It assumes equal costs for both kinds of errors. A 99% accuracy can be excellent, good, mediocre, poor, or terrible depending on the problem.**
    

### Misclassification Rate:

* The misclassification Rate is defined as **the ratio of the sum of False Positive and False Negative by Total(TP+TN+FP+FN).**
    
* **The misclassification Rate is also called Error Rate.**
