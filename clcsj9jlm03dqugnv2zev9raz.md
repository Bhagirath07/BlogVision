# What is the difference between long data and wide data?

* There are many different ways that you can present the same dataset to the world.
    
* Let's take a look at one of the most important and fundamental distinctions, whether a dataset is wide or long.
    
* The difference between wide and long datasets boils down to whether we prefer to have more columns in our dataset or more rows.
    

## Wide Data

**A dataset that emphasizes putting additional data about a single subject in columns is called a wide dataset.**

* Because, as we add more columns, the dataset becomes **wider**.
    

## Long Data

**A dataset that emphasizes including additional data about a subject in rows is called a long dataset.**

* Because, as we add more rows, the dataset becomes **longer**.
    
* It's important to point out that there's nothing inherently good or bad about wide or long data.
    

In the world of data wrangling, we sometimes need to make a long dataset wider, and we sometimes need to make a wide dataset longer.

However, it is true that, as a general rule, data scientists who embrace the concept of tidy data usually prefer longer datasets over wider ones.
