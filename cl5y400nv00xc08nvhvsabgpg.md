- In **Logistic Regression**, **does not mean that it is a regression algorithm.**

- Logistic Regression extends l**inear regression with a logistic function to make it suitable for classification.**

- It is arguably the simplest machine learning algorithm for classification tasks.

- It is one of the **most powerful machine learning algorithms** that can be used for **binary classification problems such as classifying emails or SMS as spam or not spam.**

### Assumption of Logistic Regression

- Below are the assumptions of the logistic regression algorithm that you should know:


1. **It assumes that there is an appropriate structure of the output label.**

2. **All observations are independent of each other.**

3. **There is little or no multicollinearity in the dataset.**

4. **It also assumes that the dataset consists of a very large sample of the population.**
