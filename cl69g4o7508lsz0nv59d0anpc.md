# Fundamentals of Machine Learning that Every Beginner Should Know.

The fundamentals of Machine Learning are shown in 5 concepts.

- Labels
- Features
- Models
- Regression
- Classification






### 1.  Labels



- **Labels **are the** variables** whose value we predict.

- A label can be any value we predict, like **the future price of the stock**, **the type of animal in the image**, or even **predict what word the person will type next**.

- So, any value we predict is represented as a label in machine learning.

- While this is not the rule of thumb, **most machine learning practitioners represent the labels by Y**.



### 2. Features


- Since labels are something that we predict, so we can say that labels are the output values we get after using machine learning.

- Features are **input values that we use to predict labels**.

- Again, this is not the rule of thumb, but **most practitioners represent features by X**.

- Now features are of two types **dependent ** and **independent**.

- **Independent ** features are **represented on the x-axis** and the **dependent **features are **represented on the y-axis**.



### 3. Models


- A model defines **the relationship between labels and features** which are the **input variables** and **the predicted value**.

- There are two stages in the model process which are **training **and **testing**.

- **Training**: Training means that we fit **the data on the algorithm** so that **the model learns from features**.

- **Testing**: Training means testing **the model on new unseen** examples **performed on a new set of data**.


### 4. Regression


- in Machine Learning, there are two types of models, and **regression** is one of them.

- Regression means **predicting continuous values**.

- The type of problems where regression models are used like **predicting the value of stock prices**, **predicting the value of house prices**, etc.

- Regression models are used **while predicting future values by using historical and present data**.


### 5. Classification


- As mentioned above, there are two main types of models in machine learning, **classification **models are the other.

- **Classification models** are used to **predict discrete values**.

- The types of problems where classification models are used are problems such as **classifying email as spam or not spam** and **classifying whether the person is wearing a mask or not**.
