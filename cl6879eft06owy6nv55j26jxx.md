# Data Science Interview Question 10

# What are different types of Neural Networks?



- Neural Networks are classified according to their architectures.

- There are 7 types of neural networks that you need to know:


**1. Perceptron**

> - A **Perceptron ** is an **Artificial Neuron**. It is the simplest possible Neural Network. **Neural Networks are the building blocks of Machine Learning.**

**3. Multilayer Perceptron**

> - Multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a supplement to the **feed-forward neural networks**. It consists of **three types of layers**â€”the **input layer**, **output layer**, and **hidden layer**.

**5. Convolutional Neural Networks**

> - Convolutional Neural Networks are **a special type of feed-forward artificial neural network** in which **the connectivity pattern between its neuron is inspired by the visual cortex**.

**6. Recurrent Neural Networks**

> -  A recurrent neural network (**RNN**) is a type of artificial neural network that uses **sequential data or time series data**.
