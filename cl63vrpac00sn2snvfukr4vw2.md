# How to become a Data Scientist?

# What is Data Science?

- Data Science is all about **using various techniques, and algorithms to analyze large amounts of datasets (both structured & unstructured), to extract useful data insights, thus applying them in various business domains.**

# Why there's a demand for Data Scientists?

- **Data is being generated day by day at a massive rate** and in order to process such massive data sets, Big Firms, Companies are hunting for good data scientists to extract **valuable data sets and use them for various business strategies, models, and plants.**

# How to become a Data Scientist?

- Finally, let's dive into the steps to becoming a data scientist.

## Step 1: Learn Python

- Python is the most common coding language, **used by the majority of Data scientists.**

- Because of its **simplicity**, **versatility**, and being pre-equipped with powerful libraries useful in data analysis and other aspects of Data Science.


## Step 2: Learn Statistics

- If Data Science is a language, then **statistics is basically the grammar.**

- Statistics is basically the method of **analyzing and Interpretation of large data sets.**


## Step 3: Data Collection / Learn SQL

- This is one of the **key and important steps in the field of Data Science**.

- This skill involves knowledge of various tools to import data from both local systems, such as CSV files, and scraping data from websites, using the **beautiful-soup python library**.

- These are the steps where most of the time is being spent as a Data Scientist.

- **Data Cleaning is all about obtaining the data, fit for doing work and analysis, by removing unwanted values.**


## Step 5: Exploratory Data Analysis

- **Exploratory data analysis is the essential part when talking about data science. **

- The data scientist has many tasks including:


1. **Data Analysis** using ** *Pandas* ** and ** *Numpy* **
2. **Data Manipulation**
3. **Data Visualization**


## Step 6: Machine Learning

- **Machine Learning is the core skill required to be a Data Scientist.**

- Machine learning is used to **build various predictive models, classification models**, etc.


## Step 7: Deep Learning

- **Deep Learning on the other hand is an advanced version of Machine Learning or is a subset of Machine Learning.**

- Which deploys the use of Neural Networks, a framework that combines various machine learning algorithms for solving various tasks, for training data.


## Step 8: Learn Deploying of Machine Learning Model

- Deployment is basically the process of making your Machine Learning Model available to end-users for use.

- This is achieved by the integration of the model with various existing production environments.



## Step 9: Real World Testing
