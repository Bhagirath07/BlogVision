# What is TensorFlow?

TensorFlow is an open-source software library released in 2015 by Google to **make it easier for developers to design, build, and train deep learning models.**

* TensorFlow originated as an internal library that the Google developers used to build the models in-house, and we expect additional functionality to be added in the open-source version as they are tested and vetted in an internal flavor.
    
* Although TensorFlow is the only one of several options available to the developers and we choose to use it here because of its thoughtful design and ease of use.
    
* **At a high level, TensorFlow is a Python library that allows users to express arbitrary computation as a graph of data flows.**
    
* Nodes in this graph represent mathematical operations, whereas edges represent data communicated from one node to another.
    
* Data in TensorFlow are represented as tensors, which are multidimensional arrays.
    
* Although this framework for thinking about computation is valuable in many different fields, TensorFlow is primarily used for deep learning in practice and research.
