## Step 5: Learn Deep Learning

- Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers. 

- These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain albeit far from matching its ability allowing it to “**learn**” from large amounts of data. 

- While a neural network with a single layer can still make approximate predictions, additional hidden layers can help to optimize and refine for accuracy.
