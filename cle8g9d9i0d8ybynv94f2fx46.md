 # What is the difference between CNN and RNN?

## CNN (Convolutional Neural Network):

• Best suited for spatial data like images.
• CNN is powerful compared to RNN.
• This network takes a fixed type of inputs and outputs.
• These are ideal for video and image processing.


## RNN (Recurrent Neural Network):

• Best suited for sequential data.
• RNN supports fewer feature sets than CNN.
• This network can manage arbitrary input and output lengths.
• It is ideal for text and speech analysis.
