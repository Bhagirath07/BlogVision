# Steps to create a Data Science Project Report

## Step 1: Introduce the Topic and the Problem Statement

- The first step is to introduce the topic of your data science project.

- When introducing the topic, make sure to present the problem statement also.

- You create a project to show your analysis and findings to solve a problem, and the problem that you are solving is nothing but the problem statement.


## Step 2: Explain Your Approach to Solving the Problem

- To explain your approach to solving the problem and make sure you have a good understanding of the problem statement.

- After understanding the problem statement, write about your plan for solving the problem.

- You are creating your project report after finishing the project. So, it will be easy for you to explain the structure of your project.

- Here you have to explain the step-by-step process you have used in your project to solve a problem.


## Step 5: Perform Analysis of Your Project

- It is an important step in your data science project report.


> 1. Explain whatever you have analyzed in your data.

> 2. If you have created data visualizations, explain them.

> 3. If you are choosing some features and dropping some, explain why you did so.

> 4. Explain your approach in every part of the project.



## Step 6: Conclude Your Project

- Make sure whatever you write in your conclusion is coming from the analysis and findings of your project.


## Step 7: Mentioned the References

- At last, mention the references you used in any part of your project.
