# What are the features of TensorFlow?

• One of the main features of TensorFlow is its ability to build neural networks.

• By using these neural networks, machines can perform logical thinking and learn similarly to humans.

• There are other tensors for processing, such as data loading, preprocessing, calculation, state, and outputs.

• It is considered not only as deep learning but also as the library for performing tensor calculations, and it is the most excellent library when considering the deep learning framework that can also describe basic calculation processing.

• TensorFlow describes all calculation processes by calculation graph, no matter how simple the calculation is.
