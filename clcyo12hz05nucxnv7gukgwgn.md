# #54 Machine Learning & Data Science Challenge 54

# Why deep learning is better than machine learning?

* Though traditional ML algorithms solve a lot of our cases, they are not useful while working with high-dimensional data which is where we have a large number of inputs and outputs.
    
* For example, in the case of handwriting recognition, we have a large amount of input where we will have different types of inputs associated with different types of handwriting.

* The second major challenge is to tell the computer what features it should look for that will play an important role in predicting the outcome as well as achieving better accuracy while doing so.
