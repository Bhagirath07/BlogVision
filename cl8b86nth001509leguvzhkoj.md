# #2 Machine Learning & Data Science Challenge 2

# Describe the general architecture of Machine learning.

### 1. Business Understanding: 

- Understand the given use case, and it's good to know more about the domain for which the use cases are built.


### 2. Data Acquisition and Understanding: 

- Data gathering from different sources and understanding the data. Cleaning the data, handling the missing data if any, data wrangling, and EDA( Exploratory data analysis)


### 3.Modelling: 

- Feature Engineering - scaling the data, feature selection - not all features are important. 

- We use the backward elimination method, correlation factors, PCA and domain knowledge to select the 
features.

- Model Training based on trial and error method or by experience, we select the algorithm and train with 
the selected features.

- Model evaluation Accuracy of the model, confusion matrix and cross-validation.

- If accuracy is not high, to achieve higher accuracy, we tune the model...either by changing the algorithm 
used or by feature selection or by gathering more data, etc.


### 4. Deployment:

- Once the model has good accuracy, we deploy the model either in the cloud or Rasberry 
py or any other place.

- Once we deploy, we monitor the performance of the model.

- if it's good...we go live with the model or reiterate all processes until our model performance is good.
