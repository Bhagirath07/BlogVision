- To identify infected people, the authorities follow the activity of patients diagnosed in the last 14 days. This process is called **contact tracing**.

- Depending on the country and the local authority, the search for contacts is carried out either by manual methods or numerical methods.

- **DBSCAN is a density-based data clustering algorithm that groups data points in a given space.**

- The DBSCAN algorithm groups others and marks outlier data points as noise.

- So, the **DBSCAN algorithm** can be used for **the task of contact tracing.**
