# #52 Machine Learning & Data Science Challenge 52

# What is the difference between Machine Learning and Deep Learning?

* **Machine Learning is a technique to learn from that data and then apply what has been learned to make an informed decision.**
    
* The main difference between deep learning and machine learning is, **machine learning models become better progressively but the model still needs some guidance.**
    
* If a machine learning model returns an inaccurate prediction then the programmer needs to fix that problem explicitly but in the case of deep learning, the model does it by itself.
    

## Machine learning:

* Machine Learning can **perform well with small-size data**.
    
* Machine learning can work on some **low-end machines**.
    
* Features need to be identified and extracted as per the domain before pushing them to the algorithm.
    
* ML is **generally recommended to break the problem into smaller chunks, solve them and then combine the results.**
    
* In ML, **Training time is comparatively less.**
    
* In ML, **Results are more interpretable.**
    
* **No use of Neural Networks** in Machine Learning.
    
* **Solves comparatively less complex problems** in Machine Learning.
    

## Deep Learning:

* Deep Learning does not **perform as well with** **smaller datasets**.
    
* Deep Learning involves **many matrix multiplication operations that are better suited for GPUs.**
    
* Deep learning algorithms **try to learn high-level features from data.**
    
* DL generally **focuses on solving the problem end to end.**
    
* In DL, **Training time is comparatively more.**
    
* In DL, **Results may be more accurate but less interpretable.**
    
* **Uses Neural Networks** in Deep Learning.
    
* **Solves more complex problems** in Deep Learning.
