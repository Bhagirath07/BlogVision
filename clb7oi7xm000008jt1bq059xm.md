# What is Mean Square Error?

*   **The Mean squared error tells you how close a regression line is to a set of points. It does this by squaring the distances from the ends to the regression line (these distances are the "Errors").**
    
*   The line equation is **y=Mx+B**.

*   We want to find **M(slope)** and **B(y-intercept)** that minimizes the squared error.
