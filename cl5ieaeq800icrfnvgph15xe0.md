# Most Famous Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms

- Unsupervised learning models are utilized for three main tasks such as **clustering**, **association**, and **dimensionality reduction**. 

- Below weâ€™ll define each learning method and highlight common algorithms and approaches to conduct them effectively.


## Most Famous Unsupervised Learning Algorithms


### **1. Clustering **

- **Clustering is the most famous unsupervised learning algorithm. **

- Its main purpose is **grouping similar data points into the same groups. **

> ** Clustering algorithms are used to process raw, unclassified data objects into groups represented by structures or patterns in the information. **

**Types of Clustering: **


> - **Hierarchical Clustering**
> 
> - **K - means**
> 
> - **Fuzzy Clustering**
> 
> - **Mixture Models**




## **2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) **

- Principal component analysis (PCA) is **a technique to bring out strong patterns in a dataset by suppressing variations. **

> **PCA is an unsupervised technique used to reduce the dimensionally of high-dimensional datasets while preserving the original structure and relationships between data.  **

## **3. Neural Networks**


- **Artificial Neural Networks are normally called Neural Networks (NN). **

- **Neural networks are in fact multi-layer Perceptrons. **

> **Neural nets are most commonly used as a supervised learning algorithm but there are some cases when they are used in an unsupervised learning manner.**
> 
> - for example **Koehnen's Self Organizing Map (KSOM) **
