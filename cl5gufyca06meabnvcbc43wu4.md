# Machine Learning

## Introduction:

- **Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.**


- Machine learning is an important component of **the growing field of data science**. 


- With the use of statistical methods, **algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions and to uncover key insights in data mining projects**. 

- These insights subsequently drive **decision-making within applications and businesses, ideally impacting key growth metrics**. As big data continues to expand and grow, the market demand for data scientists will increase. 

- They will be required to help identify the most relevant business questions and the data to answer them.


## **How machine learning works ?**

**The learning system of a machine learning algorithm into three parts.
**


> **1. A Decision Process**
> 
> - machine learning algorithms are used to make a prediction or classification. Based on some input data, which can be labeled or unlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate of a pattern in the data.


> **2. An Error Function**
> 
> - An error function evaluates the prediction of the model. If there are known examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess the accuracy of the model.

> **3. A Model Optimization Process**
> 
> - If the model can fit better to the data points in the training set, then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the known example and the model estimate.


## **Machine Learning Methods**

- There are fall into **three categories.**

  1. **Supervised ** Machine Learning
  2. **Unsupervised** Machine Learning
  3. **Reinforcement** Machine Learning

- ### **Supervised Machine Learning**

  > - **Supervised learning** is the type of machine learning in which **machines are trained using well “**labeled**” training data, and on basis of that data, machines predict the output.**

- ### **Unsupervised Machine Learning**

  > - **Unsupervised learning** is a type of machine learning in which **models are trained using unlabeled datasets and are allowed to act on that data without any supervision.**

- ### **Reinforcement Machine Learning**

  > - **Reinforcement machine learning** is a **machine learning model that is similar to supervised learning, but the algorithm isn’t trained using sample data. **

  > - **This model learns as it goes by using trial and error. A sequence of successful outcomes will be reinforced to develop the best recommendation or policy for a given problem.**
