# What are the components of the Time -Series?

### Time series analysis:

* **It provides a body of techniques to understand a dataset better.**
    
* The most useful one is the decomposition of the time series into four constituent parts:
    

1. **Level**\- The baseline value for the series if it were a straight line.
    
2. **Trend** \- The optional and linear, increasing or decreasing behavior of series over time.
    
3. **Seasonality** \- Optional repeated patterns /cycles of behavior over time.
    
4. **Noise** \- The optional variability in the observations that cannot be explained by the model.
