# What is perceptron and how it is related to human neurons?

* If we focus on the structure of a biological neuron, it has dendrites, which are used to receive inputs. These inputs are summed in the cell body and using the Axon it is passed on to the next biological neuron as shown below.

**Dendrite**: Receives signals from other neurons

**Cell Body**: Sums all the inputs

**Axon**: It is used to transmit signals to the other cells

* Similarly, a perceptron receives multiple inputs, applies various transformations and functions, and provides an output.
    
* A Perceptron is a linear model used for binary classification. It models a neuron, which has a set of inputs, each of which is given a specific weight.
    
* The neuron computes some function on these weighted inputs and gives the output.
