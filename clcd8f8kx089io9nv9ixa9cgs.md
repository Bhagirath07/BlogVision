# What is False Positive Rate & False-negative Rate?

### False Positive Rate:

* The false positive rate (FPR) is calculated as **the number of incorrect positive predictions divided by the total number of negatives.**
    
* The best false positive rate is 0.0, whereas the worst is 1.0. It can also be calculated as 1 â€“ specificity.
    

> $$SN = TP / TP*FN = TP / P$$

### False Negative Rate:

* The false negative rate (FPR) is calculated as **the number of incorrect positive predictions divided by the total number of positives.**
    
* The best false negative rate is 0.0, whereas the worst is 1.0.
