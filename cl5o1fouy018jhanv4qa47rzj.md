# Data Science Interview Question 3

# How to choose between Normalization or Standardization to scale the features of a dataset?

- ### Normalization:

>  - During normalization, **the values are shifted and resized so that they end up being between 0 and 1. **


- ### Standardization:

 > - The standardization method ** first subtracts the mean value and then divides it by standard deviation so that the resulting distribution of the features has a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. **



- You don't need to use both standardizations at the same time for rescaling the data.

-  You need to use normalization when the dataset does not follow normal distribution.

- You need to use standardization when the dataset follows a normal distribution.
