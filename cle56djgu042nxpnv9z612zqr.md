# #111 Machine Learning & Data Science Challenge 111

# List a few limitations of Tensorflow.

• Has the GPU memory conflicted with Theano if imported in the same scope?

• It has dependencies with other libraries.

• Requires prior knowledge of advanced calculus and linear algebra along with the pretty 
good understanding of machine learning.
