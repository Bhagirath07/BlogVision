- **Overfitting **means **the machine learning model performed very well on the training data but does not generalize well.**

- This happens when the model is very complex compared to the amount and noise of the training dataset.

- Here are some of the steps you can take to avoid overfitting:


> 1. Simplify the machine learning model by selecting one of the fewer parameters by reducing the number of features in the training dataset or by constraining the model.
>
> 2. Collect more training data, and if you have a limited amount of data, increase the size of the training data.
>
> 3. Remove outliers and explore your data further to correct more data errors.
